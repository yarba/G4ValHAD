This package is meant for testing gamma-nuclear interactions
(and potentially lepto-nuclear interactions as well, if neede
in the future).

We simulate gamma+A interactions, and we look at the double
differential spectra of secondary proton, pi-, or pi+, that
we compare vs available experimental data.

We currently model the following cases:

1. 300 MeV gamma on Cu target. 
   We look at the spectra of secondary protons, at theta=45, 90, 
   or 135 degree, as a function of proton's kinetic energy.
   Experimental data from: 
   R. Schumacher et al., Phys. Rev. C 25, 2269 (1982)

2. 668 MeV gamma on Cu or Pb target.
   In the case of Cu target, we look at the spectra of secondary 
   pi+/-, at theta=28.4 or 44.2 degree, as a function of pion
   momentum.
   In the case of Pb target, we look at the spectra of pi-/+ at
   44.2 degree, as a function of pion momentum.
   Experimental data from:
   K. Baba et al., Nucl. Phys. A322, 349 (1979)
   
3. In the near future we plan to add gamma on C test.
   Experimental data from:
   K. Baba et al., Nucl. Phys. A306, 292 (1978)
