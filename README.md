# G4ValHAD
Geant4 process-level apps (HAD)

General Notes

In order to have write permissions (git push, etc.), one can checkout using ssh:
git clone git@github.com:yarba/G4ValHAD.git

If this is the first time one wants to check out on a particupalr computer, it'd makes sense 
to generate an ssh public key and add it to the GitHub repo.
Instructions here:
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

NOTE: more info on denied access/key is here:
https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/

If one wants read-only access (no commit of changes), one can do:
git clone https://github.com/USER/PACKAGE
