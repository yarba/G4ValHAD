   *** INTRODUCTION ***

This package is intended for comparison of results of the G4 code/model(s)
for stopping particle vs experimental data.

   MODELS

Staring Geant4.9.6 Bertini Cascade model has been chosen as a principal model 
for simulating capture at rest of pi-, K-, Sigma- and Omega.
It replaces previously available models (aka "traditional" or CHIPS; both have been 
dicommissioned post-geant4.9.6, i.e. starting development release geant4.9.6-ref01)

Also starting Geant4.9.6 the FTF model is chosen as a principal model to simulate
annihilation of anti-baryon.
In this test, we use the FTF interface to model pbar annihilation, and we compare 
vs experimental data.

   EXPERIMENTAL DATA SETS

We currently use experimental data (table) for stopped pi- from this paper:
-- R.Madey et al., Phys.Rev.C25, 3050 (1982)

For pbar annihilation, there's a large volume of materials, incl. from LEAR
(Crystal Barrel), as well as much earlier data from 70's and 80's.
As a starting point we use these 3 reviews:
-- C. Amsler, Rev. Mod. Phys. 70, 1293 (1998)
-- C. Amsler and F. Myher, Ann. Rev. Nucl. Part. Sci. 41, 219 (1991)
-- C.B. Dover et al., Prog. Part. Nucl. Phys., Vol.29, pp.87-173 (1992)

Unfortunately, the collection of experimental data for K- and Sigma- capture appears 
to be limited to K- or Sigma- on H only.
However, we have recently extreacted the initial set of experimaental data points
for validation, from these papers:
-- K.Larson et al., Phys.Rev.D47,799(1993) (K-)
-- M.Goossens et al., in in Low and Intermediate energy kaon physics,
   ed.E.Ferrari and G.Violini (Riedel, Holland, 1980), p.243 (Sigma-)
   
For mu- capture, we're using data from 
-- P.Singer, Springer Tracts in Modern Physics, 71, 39 (1974)
-- R.M.Sundelin et al., Phys.Rev.Lett, Vol.20, Number 21, 1198 (1968)

   OBSERVABLES OF THE TEST

At present, for each type of incoming particles, we look at the quantities 
of general interest, such as overal multiplicity of the secondary paricles 
or multiplicities of secondary particles of specific type (pions, kaons,...), 
momentum spectra, etc.

Where experimental data are available, we look for specific distributions. 
For example, for pi- absorptions we look at the number of outcoming neutrons
as a function of the kinetic energy of the final state particle.

   *** HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN ***

In order to compile the application, one needs to setup Geant4 version and 
the desired version of Root, for histograms.
One also needs to set several Geant4 related products, update LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
and specify work directory.
Example settings can be found in /batch/g4setup.sh.
Alternative example settings with a prefabricated, older version of geant4 can 
be found in g4setup.csh 
 
Once settings are done, the code can be build via supplied GNUmakefile (by issuing 
gmake at the system propmt), and results in test48 executable in the G4EXE area.
The gmake/GNUmakefile is operational up until most current release Geant4.9.6.
Alternative, more modern tool is a cmake, for which CMakeList.txt spec is provided.

The application can be configured at run time, with beam, target, and Geant4 model.
Example application configurations are these:
test48.picapture - pi- case
test48.kaon - K- case
test48.sigma - Sigma- case
test48.apcapture - antiproton case
test48.mucapture - muon case

The target in the pi- example is C (other targets are: N, O, Al, Cu, Ta, Pb).
The model is BertiniPreCo.
Note that the "PreCo" in it means that the Bartini cascade is backed up with 
the PreCompound model to handle de-excitation - this is currently the default
configuration, as it proves to be a better option for modeling pi- capture; 
although the Bertini cascade itself has an internal de-excitation functionality. 

The target in the K- and Sigma- examples is H (we have no other experimental data), 
and the model is Bertini. Note that it is the same Bertini cascade model,also 
backed with PreCompound, but specifically in the case of H target this doesn't 
really matter because there'd be no excited nuclei.

The pbar application runs FTF model for pbar annihilation on H.

Example usage:
> ./test48 test48.picapture
> ./test48 test48.apcapture
> ./test48 test48.kaon
> ./test48 test48.sigma
> ./test48 test48.mucapture

The output will be in a form of a Root histogram file. 
For each beam/target/model combination there will be a separate output.

For example, the output of the pi- example will result in 4 Root histogram files:
-- piminusCBertiniPreCo.root
The output of the K- and Sigma- examples are:
-- kminusHBertini.root
-- sigma-HBertini.root
(see note above on BertiniPreCo vs just Bertini).

For the pbar case, the output will result in 3 Root histogram files:
-- antiprotonHFTF.root

   *** HOW TO ANALYZE THE OUTPUT AND MAKE COMPARISON ***

Additional analysis and comparion vs available experimental data can be done with
a collection of Root macro's supplied in: PlotStopping.C

For example, to plot number of neutrons coming of pi- on Cu as a function of kinetic
energy of the final state neutron, one can do the following in a interactive Root
session:
root [0] gROOT->LoadMacro("PlotPiMinusStopping.C")
root [1] plotPiMinus("C")

If you wish to display both the above spectrum and the MC/Data, you can do the following:
root [0] gROOT->LoadMacro("PlotPiMinusStopping.C")
root [1] plotPiMinusSummary2("C")


If you wish to display results on pi- absorptions on all of the 7 targets in the test, 
you can do it like this:
root [0] gROOT->LoadMacro("PlotPiMinusStopping.C")
root [1] plotPiMinusAll()

As an example of viewing plots for K-, you can do the following:
root [0] gROOT->LoadMacro("PlotKMinusStopping.C")
root [1] plotKMinus2("H")
This will desplay two most illustrative plots that will include comparison vs data.

To display the Sigma- plot, you can do this:
root [0] gROOT->LoadMacro("PlotSigmaMinusStopping.C")
root [1] plotSigmaMinus("H")

In order to compare the output of pbar annihilation on H vs experimental data (momentum
spectra of final state charged pions or multiplicity of the final state pions) one can
do the following:
root [0] gROOT->LoadMacro("PlotAntiProtonStopping.C")
root [1] plotAntiProton("H")

NOTE1: At present, the tests are executed manually (interactively) but in the future 
some level of automation maybe added.

   *** HOW TO PRESENT EXPERIMENTAL DATA POINTS AS ROOT OBJECTS ***
   
As already mentioned, experimental data points are stored in the ASCII form.
However, for pi- we've implemented a PiMinusExpData.C utility to present/store 
them in a form of Root Graph and Root histogram (TH1F).
Example usage for Carbon target:
root [0] .L PiMinusExpData.C
root [1] PiMinusExpData("C")
This will produce an output Root file expdata_piminusC.root containing 2 objects: 
a TGraph and a TH1F with the data points.
This macro can be executed in a root session or in a "batch-like" mode.
